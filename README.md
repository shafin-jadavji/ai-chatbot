# AI Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The chatbot integrates with OpenAI's GPT model and features **context-aware** conversation handling, real-time information retrieval, and extensibility for future enhancements.

## Features
- **Conversational AI**: Uses GPT-based AI for human-like text interactions.
- **Context Awareness**: Retains conversation history for more meaningful responses.
- **Real-time API Calls**: Fetches live weather updates, news, and other real-world data.
- **Extensible**: Easily customizable for domain-specific chatbots (e.g., customer support, technical assistance).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenAI API, LangChain, FastAPI
- **Frameworks**: Flask/FastAPI for backend
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shafin-jadavji/ai-chatbot.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-chatbot

# Install dependencies
